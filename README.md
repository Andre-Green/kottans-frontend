<p>In this phase I've get acquainted with <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">https://www.udacity.com/</a>. It's a wonderful source to get learn.</p>
<p>I know something about Git before and with this course I stack my knowledge in the right place. It's a good one.</p>

### 0.1 learngitbranching.js.org. Levels Introduction Sequence and Push & Pull remote

<hr />

<p>In this phase I've get acquainted with Linux terminal <a href="https://linuxsurvival.com/">https://linuxsurvival.com/</a>. I've already know about Linux, but I don't know how many differences they have from Windows. Good and useful source.</p>

<p>Article  "HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник.." IMHO is difficult to understand, especially vol. 2. They have a lot of new descriptions and names, that you don't know how to use. But maybe it's just a first view?..</p>
